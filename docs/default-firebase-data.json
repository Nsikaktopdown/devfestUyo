      "content" : "GDG DevFest South South was announced, the conference will bring together 1000 developers, managers and entrepreneurs on **November 16** to Uyo.  This year our team is doing big advancement in the content, we're building an extra stage to accommodate more visitors and provide three fully independent tracks on Android, Web and Google Cloud topics and introducing AI, ML and Data Science.  Our focus is the content. **We’re looking for speakers like you**, who are ready to rock the stage and deliver the best talk or workshop in the field.  <div layout horizontal center-justified> <a href=\"#\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">   <paper-button primary>Submit a proposal</paper-button> </a> </div>  ## Why is it cool to speak at the DevFest?  DevFest South South is not an ordinary tech conference, besides selecting only the best speakers, we help them to succeed in delivering an exceptional quality talk on the stage.  Here are few perks that all our speakers get:  - **Expences covered**. Hotel for 3 nights, travel costs and entrance to exclusive speaker parties are covered for all speakers. - **Professional video recording**. We work with experienced video production companies to create session recording of the best quality. Stage, screen, audio, all is recorded separately and combined later. Check the [session videos from the last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOwUnBkqmo4). - **Exposure**.

We provide information about the audience, presentation templates, feedback on the slides, all to help you to prepare.  \"It was a best DevFest I ever attended. So professional, so much enthusiasm from the community. You managed to bring the vibe of Google I/O to Ukraine.\" - David Vávra, DevFest '16 Speaker  ## What are we looking for?  We're looking for **experience-based talks**, the information that can not be found in the documentation or easily googled. We're looking for your stories, your struggles, research results and experiences with the frontier tools or technologies. Check the [list of topics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18eGvBr6wdlXsfiZM4EK6SubfL3G1RWj-ABTBN9pngNg/edit?usp=sharing) we're interested in (it is not full and updated all the time).  ### Format  You can submit as many talks as you want. This year we accept submissions in two formats:   - 40 minutes sessions.   - 2(or 3) hours workshops.  ### Talks that will not pass initial review  - Talks about a specific tool/library/project explaining how it works or how to use it.  - Talks whose focus is pitching a company or project. It’s cool that you mention your company during the presentation, but it shouldn’t be the focus of the talk.  - Proposals that are not in English.  - Recruitment talks to attract talent.  We strongly recommend you check out [speaking.io](http://speaking.io/) website from Zach Holman. It includes good tips and guidelines for speakers.   ## Timeline  **Call for Papers submission deadline is July 1, 2017.** Submission results will be announced by July 16.   Any questions?

      "brief" : "The city of Uyo is no doubt one of the most charming and neat place in Akwa-Ibom.",
      "content" : " Have you read this story about Startup Revolution published by the Nations Newpaper or changing the ICT narratives in the Niger Delta published by eTimes? A certain Mr. Hanson Johnson has been mentioned repeatedly in those articles. He is the CEO of Start Innovation Hub and that is why you should move to Uyo.In his words, “ICT is the new oil” and becoming a Web or Android developer is the gateway to unthinkable treasures the future has to offer. Everyone is going digital and we have come to accept the benefits of digital technology as could be seen in the use of smart phones, ATM and POS machines. But the story for today is about moving to Uyo.I moved to Uyo in 2011 to continue my journey towards becoming a world class web developer. I spent a few years as a lonely freelancer until I met Hanson Johnson in 2014. My life has not been the same again after that. I have been part of the Start Innovation Hub family and together we have achieved amazing results.Starting out as a junior web or android developer in Nigerian cities like Lagos and Abuja can really be difficult considering the high cost of living, competition among developers and a host of other distractions. It impedes your development as a young or aspiring developer.Often times the young developer loses focus on what is essential to his development due to survival demands in an expensive city and the confusion of new technology hype. He spends most of his early days taking funny jobs to stay afloat or trying out various technologies and struggling alone in his world.Software development is an art and becoming a world class developer today requires passion, collaboration, commitment and a conducive environment. Collaboration is key but it is pretty hard to find a community that offers you all these features with many more at an affordable price.Uyo offers aspiring or young developer the above essentials plus an amazing community of software developers, collaborating to make each other better and breeding the best for the World. Thanks to Start Innovation Hub.Move to Uyo today, develop your skills, become world class and spread the good news.Ooh, do not forget to try Fisherman.js or the legendary WhiteSoup whenever you visit Uyo. Also stop by at the Ibom eLibrary, you will be amazed.",
