      "brief" : "The city of Uyo is no doubt one of the most charming and neat place in Akwa-Ibom.",
      "content" : " Have you read this story about Startup Revolution published by the Nations Newpaper or changing the ICT narratives in the Niger Delta published by eTimes? A certain Mr. Hanson Johnson has been mentioned repeatedly in those articles. He is the CEO of Start Innovation Hub and that is why you should move to Uyo.In his words, “ICT is the new oil” and becoming a Web or Android developer is the gateway to unthinkable treasures the future has to offer. Everyone is going digital and we have come to accept the benefits of digital technology as could be seen in the use of smart phones, ATM and POS machines. But the story for today is about moving to Uyo.I moved to Uyo in 2011 to continue my journey towards becoming a world class web developer. I spent a few years as a lonely freelancer until I met Hanson Johnson in 2014. My life has not been the same again after that. I have been part of the Start Innovation Hub family and together we have achieved amazing results.Starting out as a junior web or android developer in Nigerian cities like Lagos and Abuja can really be difficult considering the high cost of living, competition among developers and a host of other distractions. It impedes your development as a young or aspiring developer.Often times the young developer loses focus on what is essential to his development due to survival demands in an expensive city and the confusion of new technology hype. He spends most of his early days taking funny jobs to stay afloat or trying out various technologies and struggling alone in his world.Software development is an art and becoming a world class developer today requires passion, collaboration, commitment and a conducive environment. Collaboration is key but it is pretty hard to find a community that offers you all these features with many more at an affordable price.Uyo offers aspiring or young developer the above essentials plus an amazing community of software developers, collaborating to make each other better and breeding the best for the World. Thanks to Start Innovation Hub.Move to Uyo today, develop your skills, become world class and spread the good news.Ooh, do not forget to try Fisherman.js or the legendary WhiteSoup whenever you visit Uyo. Also stop by at the Ibom eLibrary, you will be amazed.",
